  Use when implementation and verification are complete and you need to integrate the

  and worktree cleanup.

# Ship

## Overview

Complete the development branch and integrate the work. Final verification gate, PR management, merge, and worktree cleanup.

## Hard Gate

Must have passing verification evidence from ad-verify before shipping. If no verification has been done in this session, stop and tell the user to run ad-verify first.

## Process

### Step 1: Final verification gate

Run the full check chain one last time:

```bash
bun run build && bun run test && bun run lint
```

All must pass with output as evidence. Do not skip this even if ad-verify ran recently — code may have changed since.

### Step 2: Final blast radius check

Before marking the PR ready, grep for the primary types and functions changed in this PR across the entire codebase:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --name-only  # Files changed in this PR
# For each modified shared type/function:
grep -r "TypeName\|functionName" --include="*.ts" .
```

Any consumer not touched by this PR is a potential miss. This is the last line of defense.

### Step 3: Push and mark ready

```bash
git push
gh pr ready <number>
```

### Step 4: Risk classification

Assess the PR for merge risk:

| Auto-merge (low risk) | Confirm before merge (elevated risk) |
|---|---|
| Documentation changes | Breaking API changes |
| Config file updates | Feature deletion |
| Additive features (new files only) | Schema or data model changes |
| Isolated bug fixes | Security-sensitive changes |
| Style/formatting | Cross-repo coordination |
| Test additions | Changes to shared types with many consumers |

### Step 5: Merge

For auto-merge candidates, squash merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --squash
```

For elevated risk, present the risk assessment and wait for explicit user confirmation before merging.

### Step 6: Worktree cleanup

After merge:

```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
cd <main-worktree>
git pull origin main
```

### Step 7: Close tracking

- Verify the linked issue was closed by the merge
- For multi-repo work: link related PRs, update tracking issues

## Cross-Repo Work

For changes spanning multiple repositories, follow the coordination instructions in the repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md. The plugin's additions:

- Link related PRs across repos in PR descriptions
- Cross-repo PRs require explicit user confirmation before merging
- Update tracking issues with links to all related PRs

The PR modifies the Task interface in src/models/task.ts and the formatTask
utility in src/utils/format-task.ts. All tests pass.
Before I mark this ready for review, what checks should I run?

# Using Autopilot Dev

## Overview

Entry point skill that establishes the phase-based delivery lifecycle and enforces skill invocation discipline.

## Subagent Stop

If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill entirely.

## Lifecycle

```
ad-claim → ad-explore → ad-design → ad-plan → ad-implement → ad-verify → ad-ship
```

| Phase | Skill | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Claim | ad-claim | Claim issue, create worktree + branch + draft PR |
| Explore | ad-explore | Understand the codebase and problem space |
| Design | ad-design | Brainstorm approaches, write approved spec |
| Plan | ad-plan | Convert spec into bite-sized implementation plan |
| Implement | ad-implement | TDD execution with subagent dispatch |
| Verify | ad-verify | E2E red/green testing, code review, blast radius check |
| Ship | ad-ship | Mark PR ready, merge, clean up worktree |

## Phase Skip Rules

Not every change needs every phase:

- **Trivial changes** (< 5 lines, docs-only, config-only): claim → implement → verify → ship
- **Bug fixes with clear root cause**: claim → explore → implement → verify → ship
- **Well-specified issues** (full spec in issue body): claim → explore → plan → implement → verify → ship

When in doubt, do not skip phases. Skipping design on a "simple" change that turns out to be complex is more expensive than spending 5 minutes on design.

## The 1% Rule

If there is even a 1% chance a phase skill applies to the current task, invoke it. Check for applicable skills BEFORE any response or action — including clarifying questions.

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP — you are rationalizing your way out of a phase:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check the lifecycle. |
| "I need more context first" | That is what ad-explore does. |
| "Let me just write the code quickly" | That is what ad-implement does, with TDD. |
| "I can skip the design for this" | Every project needs a design, regardless of perceived simplicity. |
| "Tests are passing, we're done" | Unit tests ≠ verified. That is what ad-verify does. |
| "I'll clean up the PR later" | That is what ad-ship does, with blast radius checks. |
| "Let me explore the code first" | Use ad-explore — it has structured output. |
| "I know what needs to change" | Verify with ad-explore. Partial implementations may already exist. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Process skills first** (ad-explore, ad-design) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Execution skills second** (ad-implement, ad-verify) — guide what to do

"Let's build X" → ad-explore first, then ad-design, then ad-plan.
"Fix this bug" → ad-explore first, then ad-implement.

## Artifact Locations

All plan and design artifacts live on the worktree branch, not in the main repo tree:

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Design specs | `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` |
| Implementation plans | `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md` |

## Configuration

The plugin reads conventions from the repo's CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and contributing guides. Repo guidelines always override plugin defaults. The plugin provides workflow discipline — project-specific concerns belong in the project's guidelines.


@[assistant]:
Because you’re at the “ship” phase, follow the ad‑ship checklist before marking the PR ready:

1. **Final verification gate** – rerun the full chain, even if it passed earlier:
   ```bash
   bun run build && bun run test && bun run lint
   ```

2. **Blast-radius check** – list all files touched by the PR and make sure every consumer of the changed Task interface and `formatTask` utility was either updated or intentionally left alone:
   ```bash
   git diff main...HEAD --name-only
   grep -r "Task" --include="*.ts" src
   grep -r "formatTask" --include="*.ts" src
   ```
   Review any remaining call sites to confirm the new shape/behavior is safe.

3. **Push and mark ready** – once the above is clean:
   ```bash
   git push
   gh pr ready <number>
   ```

4. **Risk classification** – since you changed a shared model (`Task`) and a utility used across modes, treat this as **elevated risk**. Flag that in the PR description or review request so the reviewer knows to double-check downstream consumers.

After reviewers approve and you have explicit confirmation (because it’s elevated risk), follow the merge and cleanup steps from the checklist.
